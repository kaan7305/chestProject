Overview of Project

The goal of this project is to implement a version of the board game chess in C++. We will utilize 
object-oriented design and proper application of the programming techniques learned throughout 
the course. There will be careful attention to not just design, but also reducing code 
duplication, and well documented and tested code, with all memory leaks eliminated.
